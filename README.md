# First Flutter App

Welcome to my first Flutter app repository! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a playground where I implement new things I learn and have fun along the way. It's an evolving project, so expect frequent updates and new features as I dive deeper into Flutter and Dart.

## Project Overview

This app demonstrates a basic yet functional implementation of a word pair generator and a favorites list using Flutter. It leverages state management with the `provider` package and follows modern design principles with Material 3.

### Features

- **Random Word Pair Generator**: Generates random word pairs using the `english_words` package.
- **Favorites List**: Allows users to save and manage their favorite word pairs.
- **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between the home page and the favorites page using `NavigationRail`.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `ChangeNotifier` and `Provider` for efficient state management.

### Learnings and Fun Implementations

This repository is not just about the core functionality. It's a place where I continuously learn and experiment with new Flutter features and concepts. Here are some of the things I plan to explore and implement:

- Advanced state management techniques
- Custom animations and transitions
- Integration with APIs and backend services
- Theming and UI customization
- Performance optimizations
- Testing and debugging best practices
